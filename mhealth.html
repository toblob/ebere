            <p class="write">
                Mental illness, also called mental health disorders refers to a wide range of mental health conditions-
                disorders that affect the patient's mood, thinking and behavior. This could manifest in the following;
                depression, anxiety disorders, schizophrenia, eating disorders and addictive behavior. <br> <br>
                her-mHealth is a free mental health initiative that seeks to bridge the great lapse in mental health
                awareness in Nigeria, especially among young women. <br>
                It provides readily-accessible individual counselling/psychological therapy and structured group
                sessions
                (where necessary) for young women with, or at the risk of developing a mental illness. <br><br>
                her-mHealth initiative provides a community of survivors as well as those still battling with different
                levels
                of depression, equipping them with an efficient platform to come to terms with their mental state, as
                well
                as identify with other people in the same course without the fear of social stigma, or being judged
                whatsoever.
                This community enables them rub minds on how to overcome and master the intricacies of their state. This
                is
                against the proliferation of common social media groups where suicide is collectively idolised and
                contemplated
                and past suicide victims applauded and regarded as heroes.
